A simple locally networked game allowing up to 32 users to connect to a server and guess the random number.

Users can drop in any time (even mid match) and will be added to the rotation of guessing users.

They can also drop out with 'quit' and the server will look to the next user for a guess.

Once a correct guess is given, the game will sleep for x seconds and then restart.

Game will auto-end if the number of players drops to 0, and resume when there are 2 again.
